    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Considerable parts of the global population are affected by androgenetic alopecia (AGA). AIMS OBJECTIVE The efficacy of a foam containing nicotinic acid hexyl ester, polyphenols, zinc, glycine, and caffeine in comparison with a vehicle control foam was assessed in a double-blind vehicle-controlled study in men with AGA over 6\u00a0months. PATIENTS/METHODS METHODS Sixty-two men with AGA were assigned either to the active ingredients (verum) or the vehicle group. They applied the products twice daily on affected scalp areas over 6\u00a0months. Automated phototrichograms were obtained at baseline, after 3 and 6\u00a0months. In addition, a clinical rating by a dermatologist and by the subjects themselves was documented using standardized questionnaires. RESULTS The reduction of the telogen rate from T0 to T6 was significantly stronger in the verum group compared to the vehicle group. The reduction was significant from T0 to T3 and T6 in the verum group, but in the vehicle group only from T0 to T3, not to T6. Significantly increased hair density was noticed in both groups at all time points, but the change from T0 to T6 did not differ significantly between the groups. Cosmetic acceptance of the foam and its application regimen was generally good in both groups. Slight reddening and burning after application of verum in six cases was probably due to the presence of hexyl nicotinate. CONCLUSION CONCLUSIONS The study demonstrated a reduction of the telogen rate by a cosmetic foam in men affected by AGA, indicating a benefit for cosmetic intervention against male pattern hair loss.",
