    "abstract": " Plant-derived secondary metabolites (polyphenols/terpenes/alkaloids) and microbial exometabolites/membrane components of fermented tropical fruits are known as highly bioavailable biomolecules causing skin and hair improvement effects (wound healing, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antidiabetic, antiacne, skin/hair microbiota balancing, hair growth-promoting, and hair loss-inhibiting). Caffein is considered as a hair growth promoter. A randomized placebo- and caffein-controlled clinical trial on the efficacy of fermented papaya (FP) plus fermented mangosteen (FM) towards human hair quality and loss was conducted. Shampoo and lotion hair care products containing FP, FM, and caffein as active agents were developed and applied to 154 subjects of both sexes with clinically confirmed androgenic or diffuse alopecia for 3 months. Their clinical efficacy was assessed subjectively by questionnaires filled in by dermatologists/trichologists, and by the objective trichomicroscopical calculations. Hair and scalp skin quality was determined by microbiota pattern and ATP, SH-groups, protein, and malonyl dialdehyde quantification. Comparative clinical data showed that the experimental hair care cosmetics significantly inhibited hair loss, increased hair density/thickness, and improved hair follicle structure versus placebo and caffein controls. The cosmetics with FP and FM substantially normalized the microbiota pattern and increased ATP content in hair follicle, while inhibiting lipid peroxidation in the scalp skin, and SH-group formation in the hair shaft.",
